This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Statement, and applying an appropriate basis of preparation; and making estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.Directions given for RERA Bank account is not adhered to. Promoter has a single RERA Bank account and all the amount are deposited and withdrawn in that account and also in Bank of India 0565 account, In the absence of sufficient data to ascertain amount withdrawn from RERA bank ac conservatively we are certifying all the amount received towards booking is withdrawn. The details mentioned in Annexure A such as carpet area, booking status, unit consideration, date of agreement to sale, encumbrance status, name, KYC and mobile numbers of allottees are as provided by the management. Received amount reflecting in the particular deposit ledger has been verified with the books of accounts. We do not take responsibility of the scrutiny of books of accounts, this certificate is prepared basis the data provided to us by the management. As on the date of certificate as informed to us by the management there was no unutilised material. Land cost is taken as actuals without indexation. BU Permission for the project is received on 29/07/2020.in case on the basis of verification of ledger if the amount received is more than banakhat/vechan dastavej amount we have considered the amount received equivalent to banakhat/dastavej amount. Total amount of banakhat/vechan dastavej is inclusive of stampduty, registration fees and GST; as per the working amount withdrawn is exceeeding tthe total incurred and paid but the project has received BU permission on 29/07/2020 and hence is not required to route the funds through RERA Designated account.As a conservative approach we have shown all the amount received as withdrawn. Moreover the estimation given was on higher side as informed to us by the promoter, actual exprenditure is likely to be lower than the estimation.",
